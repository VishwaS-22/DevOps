Instructions

In this exercise we will simulate the first turn of a Blackjack game.
You will receive two cards and will be able to see the face up card of the dealer. All cards are represented using a string 
such as "ace", "king", "three", "two", etc. 

Note: Commonly, aces can take the value of 1 or 11 but for simplicity we will assume that they can only take the value of 11.

Depending on your two cards and the card of the dealer, there is a strategy for the first turn of the game, in which you have the following options:
->Stand (S)
->Hit (H)
->Split (P)
->Automatically win (W)

Although not optimal yet, you will follow the strategy your friend Alex has been developing, which is as follows:

->If you have a pair of aces you must always split them.
->If you have a Blackjack (two cards that sum up to a value of 21), and the dealer does not have an ace, a figure or a ten then you automatically win.
   If the dealer does have any of those cards then you'll have to stand and wait for the reveal of the other card.
->If your cards sum up to a value within the range [17, 20] you should always stand.
->If your cards sum up to a value within the range [12, 16] you should always stand unless the dealer has a 7 or higher, in which case you should always hit.
->If your cards sum up to 11 or lower you should always hit.

1. Calculate the value of any given card.
2. Implement the decision logic for the first turn.
